  ## Description 
  This program allows a user to answer a few short prompts to generate a professional README.md file. This file will include a title, license, and description, as well as directions for installation, usage, contribution, and testing. The file will also contain a dynamic table of contents and links to contact the developer.

  ## Table of Contents

  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Questions](#questions)

  After initializing the application by using the command ```node index.js```, the user will be prompted to answer questions about their repository in the terminal. This can be seen in the image below.

  When the user is done answering prompts, a README.md file will automatically be generated in the 'output' folder. This file will have properly styled headings, a title, and if the user chose one, a license. A snapshot of a sample output file can be seen below.
